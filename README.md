## Development

### Initial setup
Clone this repository to your local computer:

    git clone https://github.com/SAEONData/Dash_applications.git

Switch to the `Dash_applications` directory:

    cd Dash_applications/

Run the following commands to create a Python virtual environment with
the Dash components installed:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip setuptools pip-tools
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can open the `Dash_applications` folder as a project in the PyCharm IDE.
